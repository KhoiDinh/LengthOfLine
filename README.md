# LengthOfLine
Create a program that uses a function to determine the length of a line by inputting the X,Y coordinates of the line endpoints. Show the result with a precision of four decimal places. The function prototype is to be specified as follows:     double LengthOfLine (double X1, double Y1, double X2, double Y2);  // returns length of line
